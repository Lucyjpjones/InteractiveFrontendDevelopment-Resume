This resume site is a continuation on from my 'resume-project' but with the integration of new functionalties, to create a more appealing resume site and imporve the overal user experience.

The site includes a custom map using the Google Maps API, a link to an email service so that I am able to receive an email when somebody fills out the contact form, and the use of the GitHub API to showcase my portfolio by linking it to my GitHub repositories.
